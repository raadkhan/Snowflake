## Pull Request Checklist

This file outlines a list of common things that should be addressed before opening a PR. It's built from previous issues we've seen in a lot of pull requests. If you notice something that's being noted in a lot of PR's, it should probably be added here to help save people time in the future.

- [ ] **Start of document comments**: each `.cpp` and `.h` file should have a comment at the start of it. See files in `src/sample_package` for examples.
- [ ] **Function comments**: All function definitions (usually in the `.h` file) should have a javadoc style comment at the start of them. For examples, see the classes defined in `src/sample_package`
- [ ] **Remove commented out code**
- [ ] **Remove extra print statements**: for example, those just used for testing
